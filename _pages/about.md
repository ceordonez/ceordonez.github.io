I am a Civil Engineer from the University of Chile and Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences. Currently, I am post-doctoral researcher at the [Aquatic Physics group](https://www.unige.ch/forel/en/physique-aqua/) at F. -A Forel for environmental and aquatic science, University of Geneva.

My main interests go from aquatic physics, greenhouse gas emissions from ocean and fresh waters, and to climate change interactions in water bodies. My Ph.D. thesis was about methane cycles in lakes, and specifically on oxic methane production dynamics in lakes.

Luckily, my research work includes many of the activities that I enjoy, such as traveling, hiking, and photography.
