I am a Civil Engineering from the University of Chile and currently, I am a final year Ph.D. student at the [Aquatic Physics group](https://www.unige.ch/forel/en/physique-aqua/) at F. -A Forel for environmental and aquatic science, University of Geneva.

My main interests go from aquatic physics, greenhouse gas emissions from ocean and fresh waters, and climate change interactions in water bodies. My Ph.D. thesis is mainly about methane cycles in lakes, and specifically on methane production in oxic conditions.

Luckily my studies are along with a lot of activities that I enjoy such as traveling, hiking, and photography.
