I am a Civil Engineer from the University of Chile and currently, I am a final year Ph.D. student at the [Aquatic Physics group](https://www.unige.ch/forel/en/physique-aqua/) at F. -A Forel for environmental and aquatic science, University of Geneva.

My main interests go from aquatic physics, greenhouse gas emissions from ocean and fresh waters, and to climate change interactions in water bodies. My Ph.D. thesis is mainly about methane cycles in lakes, and specifically on methane production in oxic conditions.

Luckily, my research work includes many of the activities that I enjoy, such as traveling, hiking, and photography.
