Work experience
======

### Research Experience:
* **Postdoctoral researcher** \|2022-Present\| Aquatic Physics group, University of Geneva, Switzerland.
* **Research Assistant** \|2015-2017\| Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR)2, University of Chile, Chile.
The goal of this project is to study the transport of urban pollutants flowing into the Andean
cryosphere. My work consists in:
  * The comparison and validation of the performance of weather forecasting and chemical models (WRF-CHIMERE) to simulate the transport of urban pollutants into the Andean cryosphere.
  * The development of a Python-based assessment tool to compare, semi-automatically, a group of model simulations against measurements.
* **Research Assistant** \|2012-2014\|, Civil Engineering Department, University of Chile, Chile.
The aim of this project was to characterize physical and biochemical processes in salty lagoons. During this work, I:
  * Performed field work measurements in Huasco salty lagoon and helped with data analysis to study sediment-water interface in salty lagoons.
  * Performed the analysis and comparison of field data with laboratory experiments for oxygen transportation in salty lagoons.
